# Case Study: Ecommerce Application with Micro Frontends in Angular

## Overview

### **Client Background**
A leading ecommerce company aimed to modernize its monolithic application to improve scalability, team autonomy, and faster feature releases. The existing system, built as a monolith, faced challenges such as:

- Slow feature rollout due to complex dependencies.
- Difficulties in scaling individual features.
- Lack of flexibility in adopting new technologies.

The solution required breaking down the monolithic application into independently deployable micro frontends (MFEs), ensuring a seamless user experience while allowing modular scalability.

### **Business Objectives**

The primary goals of the project were:

- **Modularization:** Decouple business features for independent development.
- **Scalability:** Allow independent scaling of features like product catalog, cart, and checkout.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enhance loading times with lazy loading and dynamic imports.
- **Cross-team Collaboration:** Enable parallel development with minimal dependencies.
- **Consistent User Experience:** Maintain shared state and authentication across MFEs.

## Requirements Analysis

### **Key Functional Requirements**

1. **Product Catalog:**
   - Display product listings with filters and search capabilities.
   - Ensure seamless navigation between product details and cart.

2. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Persistent cart state across sessions.
   - Synchronization of cart data across multiple devices.

3. **Checkout Process:**
   - Multi-step checkout with payment gateway integration.
   - Validation and order confirmation processes.

4. **User Account Management:**
   - User profile, order history, and saved addresses.
   - Secure authentication and authorization.

5. **Order Management System:**
   - Handle order processing with automated status updates.
   - Integration with external suppliers for inventory management.

6. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - AI-based product recommendations.
   - Tracking user behavior for personalized experiences.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:** Optimize initial load time and minimize resource consumption.
- **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization across MFEs.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure modular structure for ease of updates and enhancements.
- **Resilience:** Minimize downtime with fault-tolerant microservices.
- **Observability:** Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.

## Solution Approach

### **Architecture Overview**

The solution was designed around the micro frontend architecture, comprising:

- **Host Application (Shell):** Provides global layout, authentication, and shared resources.
- **Independent MFEs:** Separate applications for product catalog, cart, checkout, and user profile.
- **Shared State Management:** Centralized data handling for consistency across MFEs.
- **Dynamic Loading:** Lazy loading of MFEs based on user interactions.

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                 Host Application (Shell)          |
|  - Provides global layout & authentication        |
|  - Dynamically loads micro frontends              |
|  - Handles shared dependencies (NgRx, styles)     |
+---------------------------------------------------+
                        |

|  Product MFE          |  |  Cart MFE              |  |  Checkout MFE         |
|  - Product listing    |  |  - Manage cart         |  |  - Handle payment     |
|  - Product details    |  |  - Sync with API       |  |  - External gateways  |
+----------------------+  +----------------------+  +----------------------+

## Deployment Strategy

### **Infrastructure Requirements**

- **Cloud Deployment:** Utilizing Kubernetes for auto-scaling and orchestration.
- **Containerization:** Each MFE deployed as a separate container.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Automated pipelines for independent deployments.

#### **Deployment Workflow**

```
+------------+          +-------------+           +--------------+
|  Developer |  --> CI  |  Build MFE   |  --> CD   |  Deploy to    |
|  Commit    |          |  Container  |           |  Kubernetes  |
+------------+          +-------------+           +--------------+
```
